# 🧠 C-Compliment

A simple and efficient C++ program to compute the **1's complement** and **2's complement** of a binary number.

## 📌 Description

This project demonstrates how to:
- Take a binary number as input
- Validate the input for binary format
- Compute the 1's complement (bitwise NOT)
- Compute the 2's complement (by adding 1 to the 1's complement)

It is a great learning tool for understanding binary number systems, bitwise operations, and handling strings in C++.

## 🚀 Features

- Input validation to ensure only binary digits are processed
- Clear and modular code structure
- Easy-to-understand logic for beginners in C++

## 💻 How It Works

1. User inputs a binary number (as a string)
2. The program calculates:
   - 1's complement by flipping each bit
   - 2's complement by adding 1 to the 1's complement using binary addition logic
3. Results are printed to the console

## 📂 Files

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main logic of the program

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.

### Using g++:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o C-Compliment
./C-Compliment
